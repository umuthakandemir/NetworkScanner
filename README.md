# Network Scanner
This project provides a simple network scanner application using Python and the scapy library. It scans the network for devices based on a given IP range entered through the command line and lists the IP and MAC addresses of active devices.

## Features
Network scanning: Scans the network for devices using ARP requests in the specified IP range.
Easy to use: Quickly perform a scan by entering the IP range via the command line.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Scapy library
To install the Scapy library:

 ```bash
pip install scapy
```

## Usage
You can run the script from the terminal or command line as follows:

```bash
python network_scanner.py -r <IP_RANGE>
```

## Example:

```bash
python network_scanner.py -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

This command will scan for all devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 IP range.

## Output
Upon completion of the scan, it will display the IP and MAC addresses of all detected devices.

## **LÄ±KE:**
```bash
python scan.py -r 10.0.2.0/24

Ether / ARP who has 10.0.2.3 says 10.0.2.4 ==> Ether / ARP is at 08:00:27:f7:fc:e4 says 10.0.2.3 / Padding
```

## Code Explanation
getSourceInfo: Used to get the IP range from the command line.
requestFunction: Combines ARP and Ethernet packets to scan a specified IP range.
run: Initiates the scanning process, obtains the IP range from the user, starts the scan, and displays the results.
